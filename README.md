# Virtual-Try-On
This project is an AI-based Virtual Try-On system using the KoLoRs model from Hugging Face. It allows users to upload a person image and a clothing image, and generates a realistic try-on result without using a webcam. The model uses deep learning to preserve the personâ€™s identity, pose,and body shape while transferring the garment style naturally.
